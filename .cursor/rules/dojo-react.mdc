I'm working on a project to convert a legacy Dojo application to React using a microfrontend architecture. I need your help to build this step by step. 

The application is [describe your specific Dojo application - e.g., "a customer management system with a dashboard, data tables, forms, and visualization components"].

I plan to use these technologies:
- Single-spa as the microfrontend framework
- Dojo Toolkit (the legacy codebase)
- React 18+ for new components
- [Any other specific technologies you're using]

Please help me with:

1. Setting up the basic project structure for a microfrontend architecture that can host both Dojo and React components

2. Creating adapter components to wrap Dojo widgets in React, particularly for:
   - Dojo form controls (CheckBox, TextBox, etc.)
   - [Any other specific Dojo components you need to integrate]

3. Building a communication bridge between Dojo and React components using:
   - Event handling
   - State synchronization
   - Proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks

4. Implementing a strategy to replace Dojo components one by one while maintaining application functionality

5. Handling shared styling to ensure consistent UI during the transition

Please provide specific code examples for each part of this implementation, focusing on practical patterns that I can implement right away. I'm particularly interested in seeing how to properly destroy and replace Dojo widgets in the DOM.
