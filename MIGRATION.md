# Dojo to React Migration Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for migrating a large Dojo application to React using a micro-frontend architecture. The approach allows for incremental migration while keeping the application functional throughout the process.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Initial Structure

1. **Set up micro-frontend architecture**
   - Implement single-spa as the orchestration framework
   - Configure the root application to handle routing
   - Set up build and deployment pipelines for individual micro-frontends

2. **Create real Dojo widget adapters**
   - Wrap each Dojo widget in a React component
   - Implement proper lifecycle management for Dojo widgets
   - Ensure two-way data binding between React state and Dojo widgets
   - Add error boundaries for graceful degradation

3. **Establish state management patterns**
   - Identify data that needs to be shared between applications
   - Set up a shared state store (Context API, Redux, or MobX)
   - Create patterns for state synchronization

### Phase 2: Gradual Component Migration

1. **Identify migration priorities**
   - Map dependencies between components
   - Prioritize components with fewer dependencies
   - Create a dependency graph to identify migration order

2. **Create parallel implementations**
   - Keep the Dojo implementation functioning
   - Build React version of the component
   - Implement feature flags to toggle between implementations

3. **Test and validate in isolation**
   - Write comprehensive tests for both implementations
   - Ensure feature parity between Dojo and React versions
   - Validate that both versions can access and modify the same data

### Phase 3: Replace Components One by One

1. **Start with leaf components**
   - Begin with components that don't have child Dojo widgets
   - Replace with React implementations
   - Validate in the production environment with limited exposure

2. **Move up the component hierarchy**
   - Gradually replace parent components
   - Use adapter patterns for components with mixed children
   - Ensure proper cleanup of Dojo widgets when unmounted

3. **Implement advanced React patterns**
   - Refactor to use hooks and functional components
   - Implement performance optimizations
   - Apply modern React best practices

### Phase 4: Optimize and Complete Migration

1. **Remove adapter layers when possible**
   - Once a section is fully migrated, remove Dojo adapters
   - Optimize React component structure and props

2. **Finalize state management**
   - Consolidate state management in React
   - Remove legacy Dojo state management
   - Implement performance optimizations

3. **Complete infrastructure transition**
   - Migrate build systems to modern tools
   - Update testing frameworks
   - Refine deployment pipelines

## Implementation Details

### Dojo Widget Adapters

The core of our migration strategy involves wrapping Dojo widgets in React components. This is done through adapter components that:

1. Handle the Dojo widget lifecycle
2. Provide proper cleanup when React components unmount
3. Synchronize state between React and Dojo
4. Provide fallback UI when widgets fail to load

Example implementation:

```jsx
const DojoButtonAdapter = ({ label, onClick, disabled = false, ...props }) => {
  // Refs to store DOM node and widget instance
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  const widgetRef = useRef(null);
  
  // Initialize Dojo widget on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    let mounted = true;
    
    async function initButton() {
      try {
        // Initialize widget
        widgetRef.current = new Button({
          label: label,
          disabled: disabled,
          onClick: onClick
        });
        
        // Place in DOM and start
        widgetRef.current.placeAt(containerRef.current);
        widgetRef.current.startup();
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Error initializing Dojo widget:', e);
      }
    }
    
    initButton();
    
    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      mounted = false;
      if (widgetRef.current) {
        widgetRef.current.destroyRecursive();
      }
    };
  }, []);
  
  // Update widget when props change
  useEffect(() => {
    if (widgetRef.current) {
      widgetRef.current.set('label', label);
      widgetRef.current.set('disabled', disabled);
    }
  }, [label, disabled]);
  
  return <div ref={containerRef}></div>;
};
```

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

For robustness, we implement error boundaries around Dojo widgets with fallback UI options:

```jsx
<DojoErrorBoundary fallback={<button onClick={handleClick}>Fallback Button</button>}>
  <DojoButton label="Click Me" onClick={handleClick} />
</DojoErrorBoundary>
```

### State Management

To manage state across frameworks:

1. Use React as the source of truth for state
2. Pass state down to Dojo widgets as props
3. Handle events from Dojo widgets to update React state
4. For shared state, use a framework-agnostic state management solution

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit testing**
   - Test React components in isolation
   - Test Dojo widget adapters with mocks
   - Validate rendering and event handling

2. **Integration testing**
   - Test interactions between React and Dojo components
   - Validate data flow across the boundary

3. **End-to-end testing**
   - Validate full user journeys work across framework boundaries
   - Ensure performance meets requirements

## Challenges and Solutions

### AMD Module Loading

**Challenge**: Dojo's AMD module format may conflict with modern bundlers.
**Solution**: Use SystemJS or a custom AMD loader that works with webpack.

### Event Delegation

**Challenge**: Dojo and React have different event handling systems.
**Solution**: Normalize events at the adapter boundary.

### Memory Management

**Challenge**: Dojo widgets must be explicitly destroyed to prevent memory leaks.
**Solution**: Use React useEffect cleanup to destroy widgets when components unmount.

### CSS and Styling

**Challenge**: Mixing Dojo and React styling approaches.
**Solution**: Use CSS-in-JS libraries for React components and ensure they don't clash with Dojo styles.

## Timeline Considerations

For large applications, expect this migration to be a long-term project:

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 months
- **Phase 2**: 2-6 months (depending on application size)
- **Phase 3**: 6-12 months
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 months

Adjust based on team size, application complexity, and business priorities.

## Monitoring and Success Metrics

- Track the percentage of components migrated
- Monitor performance metrics before and after migration
- Track bug reports related to framework integration
- Measure developer productivity and satisfaction

## Conclusion

A successful migration from Dojo to React requires patience, careful planning, and a commitment to maintaining application functionality throughout the process. By using a micro-frontend architecture and proper adapter patterns, we can achieve a smooth migration with minimal disruption to users.
